### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

#1. Does the site work as-is, or did you need to tweak it to work?
Yes, the HTML site works. It shows everything that is described in the prompt. The data is accurate, and the drop-down function works normally.



#2. Try improving the result, and updating the files based on the results. Did that help?
Kind of. I input more prompts asking ChatGPT to make these adjustments to the website. 
- Add a default mode to the drop-down menu.
- Add visualizations to show the percentage of both statewide data and each county's data. 
- Change the color representing each candidate to be different. 
- Add a choropleth map that shows who won the votes for each county.
ChatGPT can generate the new code blocks that give me the first three things in the list, but it cannot make the map as I described. It just gave me the Google Street map. 



#3. Think of a journalism circumstance where you might use this sort of technique that doesn't involve elections. Describe how you would do it.
I think this kind of process can be applied to any journalistic projects that involve investigating huge amounts of, or complicated data sets, and we need to display those data sets in the form of explorable dashboard, visualizations, or some sort of interative elements that could incoperate the written stories and help readers understad the data easier.
